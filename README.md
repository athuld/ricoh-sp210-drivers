# Ricoh SP 210/211 Driver for Linux

As the official website doesn't provide linux drivers i exteacted it from https://github.com/droidzone/ricohsp210.git

Debain users can install the deb package from above repo.

Since i'm using arch , decided to make a standalone script for it

## Installation 

Run the setup.sh as root or as sudo 

```bash 
  sudo bash setup.sh
```
or 

```bash
  su
  bash setup.sh
```
